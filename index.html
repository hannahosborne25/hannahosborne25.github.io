											<h2>If I Can Do It, So Can You!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In Writing and Digital Media, we worked with many different databases to create our projects. We used Atom, GitHub, iMovie, and many more! As an individual, I wrote three blog posts that are posted on Medium. As a group we worked on a podcast and a video related to our topic: travel. All of which are posted on this website!</p>
									 <p>There are lots of great <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com">resources</a>out there if you wish to further your knowledge on travelling! </p>

										<h3>Group Video</h3>
										<p>In our group video, we discussed the ways you can help the local economy when you travel. Travel can be great for an economy, but sometimes it can destory it. Big hotels and chain restaraunts take business away from small businesses. My group interviews another group member who has travelled and has seen these problems in real life. </p>
